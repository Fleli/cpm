Chad Package Manager is _the_ best package manager. There's nothing more to say.

## Installation

Open a terminal and run the following commands:

Make a directory for the installer. It is recommended to put this somewhere easy to find, e.g. on the Desktop.

```
mkdir cpminstaller && cd cpminstaller
```

Clone the package manager's source code.

```
git clone https://github.com/Fleli/cpm
```

Build the package manager. This requires the presence of a `C` compiler and the `make` program.

```
cd cpm && make executable
```

Chad Package Manager is now available in your terminal through the `cpm` command.

You may delete the `cpm` folder after installation.
